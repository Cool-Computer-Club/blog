# Blog
Founders and Coders week one project.


## Why
This blog is being created to showcase the work of Cool Computer Club throughout the duration of FAC9. This could be used by anyone who is learning to code, those who are interested in applying to Founders and Coders, and even potential employers.

It is also being created to practice our skills in blog and webpage creation, github and pair-programming.

## What
A blog is a frequently updated online personal journal or diary.  
It is a place to express yourself to the world, share your thoughts and your passions.  
You can have collection of posts, short, informal, sometimes controversial and sometimes deeply personal. Basically, your blog is anything you want it to be.

## How
We are building the website in HTML, CSS and JavaScript, which will then be hosted on Github Pages.  
We have chosen a mobile-first approach to our design. We plan to make this responsive through media queries for the width of the screen.

We are making liberal use of a basic colour swatch, for a modern, yet vibrant feel.



## Project Features
* navbar - about, each person's blog, contact page  

Landing page:
* a bio and image for each team member - these act as links to each blog page
* buttons to the social media accounts of each team member

Blog page per author:
* articles (in summary form)
* sidebar with team member's bio (& possibly filter feature if time allows)

Full length article page:
* navbar
* full length article
* sidebar(?)

### Stretch Goals
* Sidebar to include filters for the blog posts (by date, content, etc.)
(* Highlight name of author)?
* Animations as user scrolls down the page
* Contact page


## Structure
### Tuesday design session

One blog page per individual vs One long "newsfeed" that updates as you scroll down?
**Team landing page + separate blog page for each individual**

Mobile first design vs Web first?
**Mobile first**
